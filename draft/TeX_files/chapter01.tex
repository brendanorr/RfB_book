First things first...we need to get everything together!
Blender is easy enough to install.  Head to \url{http://www.blender.org} with your favorite browser and download the appropriate version for your OS from the download section.  Blender doesn't care where you install it.  Just extract the archive and put it somewhere appropriate.  Alternatively, if you are running Linux you can use your distribution's package manager to install it.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[height=2in]{blender001}	\caption{\url{http://www.blender.org/download}}\end{figure}

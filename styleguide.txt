Oxford commas:  Use them.  In the odd sentance below notice the comma after
"iguana"
	Example:  Listing this item, an iguana, and a screwdriver with a comma
before the conjunction.  

Keystrokes should make use of the defined \keystrokei{} macro

Use inline screencap images whenever possible to help aid in visual
recognition **for first occurance only** all remaining occurances should use
Sans-serif typefaces (\textsf{} macro)

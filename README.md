A Book about Blender, RenderMan, and the Software That Binds Them
---
Documentation is the secret sauce to a successful project.  The better people
understand how something works the more likely they will find joy, satisfaction,
and passion about using it.

This book aims to 
1. Get people started with using RenderMan along with Blender
2. Help existing RenderMan users get used to Blender's nodes (and how they differ from Cycles' nodes)
3. Help existing Blender users get used to RenderMan's RIS renderer and how materials are constructed
4. To have a good time while teaching.

More to the last point this book needs to be very casual but still accurate.  Think of each chapter as more of a tutorial that builds upon the prior chapter but still focuses on one area of functionality.
